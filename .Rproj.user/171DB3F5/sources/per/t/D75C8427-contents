Estimating proportions

## Estimating Proportions $p$

Let $X$ be the count of members with a given property based on a sample of size $m$ from a population where a proportion $p$ share the property.

Then $\widehat{p} = X / m$ is an estimator of $p$. 

Assume $m p_0 \geq 10$ and $m (1-p_0) \geq 10$. 

### Eg.

$p\in (0,1)$ and consider iid Bernoulli trials $X_1, \dots, X_m \sim \mathsf{Bernoulli}(p)$.

$\widehat{p} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m X_i\,, \qquad  \mu_{\widehat{p}} = \E X_i = p\,, \qquad \sigma_{\widehat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{\Var{X_i}}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{m}}$


## $100(1-\alpha)\%$ CI for $p$

\[\widehat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{m}}\]

:::{.tipblock}
How is the standard error different from the standard error for estimate of mean?
:::

## Hypothesis test for $p$ at level $\alpha$:

Consider $H_0 : p = p_0$. The test statistic is
\[
 Z = \frac{\widehat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{p_0 (1-p_0) / m}} \,.
\]

For a hypothesis test at level $\alpha$, we use the following procedure: 
        
If $H_a : p > p_0$, then $P$-value is the area under $\mathsf{N}(0,1)$ to the right of $z$.

If $H_a : p < p_0$, then $P$-value is the area under $\mathsf{N}(0,1)$ to the left of $z$.

If $H_a : p \neq p_0$, then $P$-value is twice the area under $\mathsf{N}(0,1)$ to the right of $|z|$.

How much water? &nbsp;&nbsp;`r fa("lightbulb")`

## The question {.flexbox .vcenter}

:::{.tipblock}
How might you estimate the proportion of the earth covered by water?
:::

## Sampling {.flexbox .vcenter}

If we were to take a random sample of points on the globe, then the proportion that touched water would be a reasonable estimate of the overall proportion of water covering the earth.

:::{.warningblock}
How to take a random (i.e. representative) sample?
:::

## `r fa("lightbulb")` &nbsp;&nbsp;The task {.columns-2 .vcenter}

1. The globe will be tossed around.
2. Hit the globe with the tip of your index finger.
3. Shout:
    - "water!" if your finger touches water, or 
    - "land!" if your finger touches land.
4. We will record your observation.

**Do not flinch ;)**

## The result

Let \(p\) be the proportion of earth's surface covered with water.

- Point estimate \(\hat{p}\)
- Confidence interval for \(p\)
- Hypothesis test: \(p\) is 0.7?

## Challenge:

How could one use random numbers from the computer to pick a random spot on the globe?

Any point is characterized by a latitude (which must be between 90◦ North and 90◦ South) and a longitude (between 180◦ West and 180◦ East). 

:::{.importantblock}
Can you pick a random spot on the globe by picking a latitude between −90 to 90 at random, and a longitude between −180 and 180 at random?

Churchill &nbsp;&nbsp;`r fa("dumbbell")`

## Example: Churchill 1/n

Churchill claims that he will receive half the votes for the House of Commons seat for the constituency of Dundee. 

We are skeptical that he is as popular as he says. Suppose 116 out of 263 Dundonians polled claimed that they intended to vote for Churchill. 

Can it be concluded at significance level $0.10$ that more than half of all eligible Dundonains will vote for Churchill?

## Example: Churhill 2/n

:::{.tipblock}
What is the parameter of interest? What are the null and alternative hypotheses? 
:::

## Example: Churhill 3/n

The parameter of interest is $p$, the proportion of votes for Churchill.

The null hypothesis is $H_0 : p = 0.5$. 

The alternative hypothesis is $H_a : p < 0.5$. 

:::{.warningblock}
Since $263(0.5) = 131.5 > 10$, we satisfy the assumptions to carry out the hypothesis test using the statistic described earlier.
:::

## Example: Churhill 4/n

Based on the sample, $\widehat{p} = 116 / 263 = 0.4411$. 

The test statistic value is 
\[
\begin{aligned}
 z &= \frac{\widehat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{p_0 (1-p_0) / m}} \\
 &= \frac{0.4411 - 0.5}{\sqrt{0.5 (1-0.5) / 263}}\\
 &= −1.91 \,.
\end{aligned}
\]

The $P$-value for this lower-tailed $z$ test is  $P = \Phi(−1.91) = 0.028$. 

## Example: Churhill 5/n

Since $P < 0.10 = \alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis at the $0.05$ level. 

:::{.warningblock}
What does this mean in words? Always place the result of the hypothesis test in the context of the problem!
:::

## Example: Churhill 6/n (conclusion)

The evidence for concluding that the true proportion is different from $p_0 = 0.5$ at the $0.10$ level is compelling.


## Summary

Today discussed point estimates, CI, and hypothesis tests for population proportions.
